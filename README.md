# Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) Rebase Token

1. protocal that allows user to deposit into a vault and in return, receive  rebase token that represent their underlying balance.
2. rebase token -> balaceOf function is dynamic to show the changing balance with time.

   - balance increases lineraly with time
   - mint tokens to our users every time they perform an action (minting,burning,transfering, or ... , bridging)
3. Interest rate
   - Indivaduaaly set an inteersset rate or reach user based on some global interest rate of the protocal at the time the user deposit into the valut.
   - this global interest rate can only decrease to incentivise/reward early adopters.
   - Increase token adoption
